      "review": "A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will not be easily deflected. One of the most cherished stories of all time, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice.",

      "review": "A dystopian novel set in a totalitarian society under constant surveillance. George Orwell's 1984 is a cautionary tale about the nightmarish world of totalitarianism. Orwell's novel paints a picture of a government that will do anything to control the narrative. The story's protagonist, Winston Smith, wrestles with oppression in Oceania, a place where the Party scrutinizes human actions with ever-watchful Big Brother. Defying a ban on individuality, Winston dares to express his thoughts in a diary and pursues a relationship with Julia. These criminal deeds bring Winston into the eye of the opposition, who then must reform the nonconformist. Orwell's novel creates a world so plausible, so complete that to read it is to experience another world. 1984's unsettling relevance to today's world continues to draw readers into its eerily prescient dystopian universe.",

      "review": "A critique of the American Dream set in the Roaring Twenties. The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest works of American literature. In his novel, F. Scott Fitzgerald explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. The novel tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire, and his unrequited love and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. The book is renowned for its vivid and elegant prose, memorable characters, and profound critique of the American Dream and the moral decay of the period. Fitzgerald's novel remains as relevant and powerful as it was when it was first published in 1925.",

      "review": "A romantic novel that also critiques the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and eventually comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the Regency era in Great Britain. Austen's novel is a keen exploration of societal norms and the constraints placed on individuals based on gender and class, making it a timeless critique of social hierarchy and the pursuit of love.",

A reluctant partner in this perilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving, unambitious hobbit, who surprises even himself by his resourcefulness and skill as a burglar. Encounters with trolls, goblins, elves, and giant spiders, conversation with the dragon Smaug the Magnificent, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of the Five Armies are some of the adventures that await Bilbo. The novel stands as one of the most enduring and beloved books of the 20th century, celebrated for its vivid imagination, rich prose, and the deeply detailed world of Middle-earth created by Tolkien. The Hobbit's themes of bravery, friendship, and the quest for identity resonate with readers of all ages.",
